Project Proposal: 

Nowadays, it is common to see YouTubers advertising products, such as cosmetics and video games, on their videos. This has become a new trend of advertisement. Our project is to create an intermediary for companies and YouTubers, a website for companies to find YouTubers to advertise their products and also for YouTubers to find companies to collaborate. 

None of our team members are the target users, because none of us are YouTubers or representatives who need to sell products for their companies.

To build this website, we will use YouTube API and probably some other APIs as well.
